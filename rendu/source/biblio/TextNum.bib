  abstract = {Computational semantics, a branch of computational linguistics, involves automated meaning analysis that relies on how words occur together in natural language. This offers a promising tool to study schizophrenia. At present, we do not know if these word-level choices in speech are sensitive to the illness stage (i.e., acute untreated vs. stable established state), track cognitive deficits in major domains (e.g., cognitive control, processing speed) or relate to established dimensions of formal thought disorder. In this study, we collected samples of descriptive discourse in patients experiencing an untreated first episode of schizophrenia and healthy control subjects (246 samples of 1-minute speech; n\,=\,82, FES\,=\,46, HC\,=\,36) and used a co-occurrence based vector embedding of words to quantify semantic similarity in speech. We obtained six-month follow-up data in a subsample (99 speech samples, n\,=\,33, FES\,=\,20, HC\,=\,13). At baseline, semantic similarity was evidently higher in patients compared to healthy individuals, especially when social functioning was impaired; but this was not related to the severity of clinically ascertained thought disorder in patients. Across the study sample, higher semantic similarity at baseline was related to poorer Stroop performance and processing speed. Over time, while semantic similarity was stable in healthy subjects, it increased in patients, especially when they had an increasing burden of negative symptoms. Disruptions in word-level choices made by patients with schizophrenia during short 1-min descriptions are sensitive to interindividual differences in cognitive and social functioning at first presentation and persist over the early course of the illness.},

  abstract = {Background Machine learning systems are part of the field of artificial intelligence that automatically learn models from data to make better decisions. Natural language processing (NLP), by using corpora and learning approaches, provides good performance in statistical tasks, such as text classification or sentiment mining. Objective The primary aim of this systematic review was to summarize and characterize, in methodological and technical terms, studies that used machine learning and NLP techniques for mental health. The secondary aim was to consider the potential use of these methods in mental health clinical practice Methods This systematic review follows the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis) guidelines and is registered with PROSPERO (Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews; number CRD42019107376). The search was conducted using 4 medical databases (PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and PsycINFO) with the following keywords: machine learning, data mining, psychiatry, mental health, and mental disorder. The exclusion criteria were as follows: languages other than English, anonymization process, case studies, conference papers, and reviews. No limitations on publication dates were imposed. ResultsA total of 327 articles were identified, of which 269 (82.3\%) were excluded and 58 (17.7\%) were included in the review. The results were organized through a qualitative perspective. Although studies had heterogeneous topics and methods, some themes emerged. Population studies could be grouped into 3 categories: patients included in medical databases, patients who came to the emergency room, and social media users. The main objectives were to extract symptoms, classify severity of illness, compare therapy effectiveness, provide psychopathological clues, and challenge the current nosography. Medical records and social media were the 2 major data sources. With regard to the methods used, preprocessing used the standard methods of NLP and unique identifier extraction dedicated to medical texts. Efficient classifiers were preferred rather than transparent functioning classifiers. Python was the most frequently used platform. Conclusions Machine learning and NLP models have been highly topical issues in medicine in recent years and may be considered a new paradigm in medical research. However, these processes tend to confirm clinical hypotheses rather than developing entirely new information, and only one major category of the population (ie, social media users) is an imprecise cohort. Moreover, some language-specific features can improve the performance of NLP methods, and their extension to other languages should be more closely investigated. However, machine learning and NLP techniques provide useful information from unexplored data (ie, patients’ daily habits that are usually inaccessible to care providers). Before considering It as an additional tool of mental health care, ethical issues remain and should be discussed in a timely manner. Machine learning and NLP methods may offer multiple perspectives in mental health research but should also be considered as tools to support clinical practice.},

Here we used a semiautomated multidimensional linguistic analysis innovatively combined with a machine-driven clustering technique to characterize the speech of 67 individuals with schizophrenia. Clusters were then compared for psychopathological, cognitive, and functional characteristics. We identified two subgroups with distinctive linguistic profiles: one with higher fluency, lower lexical variety but greater use of psychological lexicon; the other with reduced fluency, greater lexical variety but reduced psychological lexicon. The former cluster was associated with lower symptoms and better quality of life, pointing to the existence of specific language profiles, which also show clinically meaningful differences. These findings highlight the importance of considering language disturbances in schizophrenia as multifaceted and approaching them in automated and data-driven ways.},

La revue a été conduite en utilisant les critères PRISMA et en sélectionnant les articles à partir de PubMed et Scopus jusqu’à octobre 2018. Les critères d’inclusion étaient les suivants~: les études qui étudiaient la présence de marqueurs linguistiques dans le discours des sujets UHR avant ou pendant la transition~; ces marqueurs devaient être repérés par des échelles spécifiques ou par des méthodes d’analyse automatisée du discours~; enfin les sujets UHR devaient être identifiés par les échelles CAARMS ou SIPS/SOPS. Sur 202~références sélectionnées, nous avons finalement inclus dix articles en langue anglaise. Nous avons pu identifier la présence d’anomalies linguistiques chez les sujets UHR (discours désorganisé, pensées illogiques, pauvreté du discours, fluences verbales sémantiques altérées…). Certaines de ces anomalies pouvaient être spécifiques de la transition psychotique. La sévérité de ces marqueurs était proportionnelle au stade évolutif du trouble, ce qui concorde avec l’hypothèse d’un continuum allant du normal au pathologique dans la schizophrénie. De plus, des méthodes d’analyse automatisée du discours chez les sujets UHR repéreraient de subtiles anomalies sémantiques et syntaxiques (une diminution de la cohérence sémantique, mais aussi de l’utilisation de pronoms possessifs et une pauvreté du discours) prédictives dans 79~à 100~\% des cas de la transition psychotique.

Des centres de détection précoce et des outils cliniques standardisés ont été créés et permettent de repérer des sujets «~à risque~» de développer un trouble psychotique. Cependant, la fiabilité de prédiction de la transition psychotique, comprise entre 15~et 25~\%, reste insuffisante. Afin d’améliorer les prises en charge, il est aujourd’hui nécessaire de mettre en évidence des marqueurs plus spécifiques du risque évolutif vers une schizophrénie. C’est pourquoi, en plus des marqueurs biologiques et d’imagerie, des équipes de recherche s’intéressent à identifier la présence d’anomalies linguistiques chez les sujets à ultra haut au risque. Plusieurs auteurs ont ainsi montré leur intérêt et celles des méthodes d’analyse automatisée du discours pour améliorer le modèle prédictif de la transition psychotique. Certaines des anomalies linguistiques, comme le discours désorganisé, les pensées illogiques, peuvent être spécifiques de cette transition. De plus, l’intensité des anomalies linguistiques est proportionnelle au stade évolutif du trouble. Des méthodes d’analyse automatisées du discours permettent, quant à elles, de repérer de subtiles anomalies sémantiques et syntaxiques (diminution de la cohérence, de l’utilisation de pronoms possessifs et une pauvreté du discours) prédictives dans 79~\% des cas de la transition psychotique. Cependant, d’une réification du langage à une désubjectivation de l’individu, cette mutation du recueil de la clinique soulève des enjeux éthiques et épistémologiques. Over the past twenty years, research in psychiatry has focused primarily on the early detection of schizophrenia. The objective has been to engage the patient with prodromal symptoms in a trajectory of care. It has also been a question of being able to offer treatment as soon as the patient “at risk” of schizophrenia triggered a possible first psychotic episode. Standardized clinical tools were developed and now allow identification of subjects at risk of developing psychotic disorders. However, the reliability of predictions of the psychotic transition, which is between 15 and 25\%, remains insufficient. In order to improve care, it is now necessary to highlight markers to refine the prediction of the risk of developing schizophrenia. Some teams are trying to identify linguistic anomalies in UHR subjects (disorganized speech, illogical thoughts, poor speech, altered semantic verbal fluencies…). Some of these abnormalities could be specific to the transition to psychosis. The severity of these markers could be proportional to the progressive stage of the disorder, consistent with the hypothesis of a continuum from normal to pathological in schizophrenia. In addition, automated speech analysis techniques in UHR subjects allow identification of subtle semantic and syntactic anomalies (a decrease in semantic coherence, but also the use of possessive pronouns and a poverty of speech) predictive in 79\% of cases of psychotic transition. Some authors demonstrate the value of using linguistic markers and automated speech analysis methods to improve the predictive model of the transition to schizophrenia. However, from reification of language to desubjectification of the individual, this transformation in clinical practice raises ethical and epistemological challenges.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Given the fundamental role of thought disorder in schizophrenia, subtle communication disturbance may be a valuable predictor of subsequent development of psychosis. Here we examined the contribution of thought and communication disturbance to the prediction of outcome in adolescents identified as putatively prodromal for psychosis. METHOD: Transcribed speech samples were elicited from 105 adolescents (54 identified as being at clinical high risk for a first episode of psychosis [CHR], and 51 demographically comparable comparison subjects) and coded for formal thought disorder (FTD) and linguistic cohesion. We then examined the association of baseline FTD/cohesion with conversion to psychosis and social and role outcome at follow-up, approximately 1 year later. RESULTS: At baseline, CHR patients who subsequently converted to psychosis (CHR+) showed an elevated rate of illogical thinking and poverty of content (POC) in their speech, relative to both typically developing controls and CHR patients who did not convert to psychosis (CHR-). CHR+ youth also used significantly less referential cohesion at baseline, indicating that they provide fewer references to persons, objects, or events mentioned in preceding utterances. Multiple regression models indicated that, among measures of FTD/cohesion, illogical thinking was uniquely predictive of subsequent conversion to psychosis, whereas POC and referential cohesion were significant predictors of social and role functioning, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the absence of fully psychotic symptoms, putatively prodromal individuals evidence signs of communication disturbance that are qualitatively similar to those seen in schizophrenia and are predictive of both conversion to psychosis and psychosocial outcome. These findings suggest that FTD measures have prognostic significance for at-risk youth.},

Novel computerized methods to characterize complex behaviors such as speech could be used to identify and predict psychiatric illness in individuals. AIMS: In this proof-of-principle study, our aim was to test automated speech analyses combined with Machine Learning to predict later psychosis onset in youths at clinical high-risk (CHR) for psychosis. METHODS: Thirty-four CHR youths (11 females) had baseline interviews and were assessed quarterly for up to 2.5 years; five transitioned to psychosis. Using automated analysis, transcripts of interviews were evaluated for semantic and syntactic features predicting later psychosis onset. Speech features were fed into a convex hull classification algorithm with leave-one-subject-out cross-validation to assess their predictive value for psychosis outcome. The canonical correlation between the speech features and prodromal symptom ratings was computed. RESULTS: Derived speech features included a Latent Semantic Analysis measure of semantic coherence and two syntactic markers of speech complexity: maximum phrase length and use of determiners (e.g., which). These speech features predicted later psychosis development with 100\% accuracy, outperforming classification from clinical interviews. Speech features were significantly correlated with prodromal symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Findings support the utility of automated speech analysis to measure subtle, clinically relevant mental state changes in emergent psychosis. Recent developments in computer science, including natural language processing, could provide the foundation for future development of objective clinical tests for psychiatry.},

  abstract = {Language deficits are prevalent in psychotic illness, including its risk states, and are related to marked impairment in functioning. It is therefore important to characterize language impairment in the psychosis spectrum in order to develop potential preventive interventions. Natural language processing (NLP) metrics of semantic coherence and syntactic complexity have been used to discriminate schizophrenia patients from healthy controls (HC) and predict psychosis onset in individuals at clinical high-risk (CHR) for psychosis. To date, no studies have yet examined the construct validity of key NLP features with respect to clinical ratings of thought disorder in a CHR cohort. Herein we test the association of key NLP metrics of coherence and complexity with ratings of positive and negative thought disorder, respectively, in 60 CHR individuals, using Andreasen's Scale of Assessment of Thought, Language and Communication (TLC) Scale to measure of positive and negative thought disorder. As hypothesized, in CHR individuals, the NLP metric of semantic coherence was significantly correlated with positive thought disorder severity and the NLP metrics of complexity (sentence length and determiner use) were correlated with negative thought disorder severity. The finding of construct validity supports the premise that NLP analytics, at least in respect to core features of reduction of coherence and complexity, are capturing clinically relevant language disturbances in risk states for psychosis. Further psychometric study is required, in respect to reliability and other forms of validity.},

  abstract = {Although most patients who experience a first-episode of psychosis achieve remission of positive psychotic symptoms, relapse is common. Existing relapse evaluation strategies are limited by their reliance on direct and timely contact with professionals, and accurate reporting of symptoms. A method by which to objectively identify early relapse warning signs could facilitate swift intervention. We collected 52,815 Facebook posts across 51 participants with recent onset psychosis (mean age\,=\,23.96 years; 70.58\% male) and applied anomaly detection to explore linguistic and behavioral changes associated with psychotic relapse. We built a one-class classification model that makes patient-specific personalized predictions on risk to relapse. Significant differences were identified in the words posted to Facebook in the month preceding a relapse hospitalization compared to periods of relative health, including increased usage of words belonging to the swear (p\,{$<$} 0.0001, Wilcoxon signed rank test), anger (p\,{$<$} 0.001), and death (p\,{$<$} 0.0001) categories, decreased usage of words belonging to work (p\,=\,0.00579), friends (p\,{$<$} 0.0001), and health (p\,{$<$} 0.0001) categories, as well as a significantly increased use of first (p\,{$<$} 0.0001) and second-person (p\,\,{$<$} 0.001) pronouns. We additionally observed a significant increase in co-tagging (p\,{$<$} 0.001) and friending (p\,{$<$} 0.0001) behaviors in the month before a relapse hospitalization. Our classifier achieved a specificity of 0.71 in predicting relapse. Results indicate that social media activity captures objective linguistic and behavioral markers of psychotic relapse in young individuals with recent onset psychosis. Machine-learning models were capable of making personalized predictions of imminent relapse hospitalizations at the patient-specific level.},

  abstract = {Depuis Snell (1852) de très nombreux psychiatres et psychanalystes se sont interrogés sur les néologismes psychotiques. Classiquement ils sont subdivisés en néologismes passifs et en néologismes actifs (Lefèvre, Séglas), suivant en cela un processus «~automatique~» ou un processus «~volontaire~». Le mot inventé, selon Séglas, «~dit tout~», autrement dit, «~dit tout~» de la pensée délirante du sujet, comme s’il en venait condenser, synthétiser les éléments, s’imposant dès lors comme une évidence. Aussi le néologisme aurait-il un «~poids~» suffisant qui permettrait au sujet de s’en contenter et de n’avoir plus rien à expliquer. Au-delà de cette singularité du langage, au-delà du seul aspect sémiologique et de son intérêt pour le diagnostic différentiel, nous verrons que le néologisme s’impose en quelque sorte de l’«~extérieur~», et s’impose parfois comme une nécessité. C’est dire qu’il ne peut simplement être un «~signe~» pour le clinicien, et qu’il ne peut endosser le vêtement du déficit. Bien au contraire, cette création, cette invention même, doit bien avoir une fonction pour le sujet. Ce sont des mots ou expressions qui sortent du langage commun, qui se séparent de la langue dite «~maternelle~», qui doivent être distingués du mot d’esprit, et qui mettent en relief le rapport singulier du sujet à son Autre, qui ont en certains cas (schizophrénie) une fonction de régulation dans le rapport à l’Autre, à la jouissance, et à la pensée même du délirant, dont la réalité, le rapport au monde, pourrait sans ce soutien partir à la dérive.},

These results are reassessed here through state-of-the-art attribution methods. We study a corpus of comedies in verse by major authors of Molière and Corneille’s time. Analysis of lexicon, rhymes, word forms, affixes, morphosyntactic sequences, and function words do not give any clue that another author among the major playwrights of the time would have written the plays signed under the name Molière.},

The EEG dataset includes data collected using a traditional 128-electrodes mounted elastic cap and a wearable 3-electrode EEG collector for pervasive computing applications. The 128-electrodes EEG signals of 53 participants were recorded as both in resting state and while doing the Dot probe tasks; the 3-electrode EEG signals of 55 participants were recorded in resting-state; the audio data of 52 participants were recorded during interviewing, reading, and picture description.},

Les choix de consommation, les goûts culturels, les déplacements ou les comportements des internautes sont de plus en plus soumis aux calculs de ces nouvelles machines à prédire. Ce dossier de Réseaux propose d’étudier la manière dont cette nouvelle forme de quantification pénètre progressivement de nombreux secteurs d’activité : les services offerts par les nouvelles plateformes numériques, les décisions judiciaires, la surveillance épidémiologique, les recommandations commerciales, les opérateurs financiers, les grands systèmes métrologiques de la ville, du transport ou du climat.  Les articles réunis dans ce dossier proposent d’abord, dans une perspective d’histoire sociale des sciences et des techniques, d’explorer les conditions qui ont rendu possible le développement des méthodes d’apprentissage automatique (machine learning) qui sont au cœur des machines à prédire. En s’appuyant sur des bases de données massives, elles permettent d’apprendre “automatiquement” des structures caractéristiques dans des bases de données massives afin d’en induire des classifications (par la reconnaissance de patterns, la détection de clusters ou l’induction de modèle). Comment ces techniques de prédiction s’inscrivent-elles dans l’histoire des sciences et des techniques et, notamment, dans l’histoire longue et tumultueuse de l’Intelligence artificielle ? C’est ensuite à la manière dont ces machines sont conçues et fabriquées que s’intéresse ce dossier en prêtant attention au travail des ingénieurs et des informaticiens qui les programmes. Enfin, les articles de ce dossier de Réseaux  s’attache à observer leur mise en oeuvre dans des champs très différents celui de la surveillance des comportements, de la prédiction du comportement sexuel ou des recommandations commerciales. À travers le calcul de bases de données massives, les nouvelles techniques de calcul numérique installent une prise nouvelle sur la société et le comportement des individus. Elles prétendent « voir » dans les comportements actuels, la forme d’un comportement à venir. Mais pour réaliser cette prédiction, et la rendre opérante, elles doivent installer un dispositif d’enregistrement des données, de calcul des informations et d’orientation des conduites qui n’est pas sans conséquences. Sur quoi reposent la crédibilité et la légitimité de ces machines prédictives ? Comment modifient-elles les manières de connaître ? Sous quelle condition et à quel point le pouvoir se délègue-t-il aux machines ? Illustration de couverture : © Garrett Coakley, “Bomb detail”.},

Nous avons procédé à deux expérimentations en utilisant des entretiens cliniques de type diagnostique réalisés avec trois groupes de patients (schizophrènes, paranoïaques et sujets présentant divers troubles délirants). Dans la première expérimentation, nous avons comparé les corpus non délirants aux corpus délirants chez un même patient et nous avons étudié si les phases délirantes de son discours montraient une cohérence textuelle plus importante ou moins importante que la cohérence textuelle des phases non délirantes. Cette première expérimentation nous a montré que les phases délirantes pouvaient apparaître comme davantage cohérentes que les phases non délirantes. Dans la seconde expérimentation, nous avons analysé les conditions d’usage d’un marqueur de cohérence textuelle qui est apparu comme particulièrement saillant en phase délirante~: le pronom relatif. Les résultats ont montré que le pronom relatif semble apparaître comme un marqueur de construction délirante dans sa fonction d’attribution de propriété des objets indéfinis. This research compares the markers of textual cohesion in delusional phases versus non delusional phases in the discourse of the same subject. We have made two experiments. In the first one we have shown that delusional phases contain as many markers of textual cohesion as non delusional phases. One of the considered markers varies in a significant manner~: the use of relative pronouns increases in delusional phases. In the second experiment we have analysed the conditions of the use of relative pronouns in the delusional phases. We have concluded that relative pronouns could be considered as markers of the delusional construction which consists in attributing properties to undefined objects of the world.},

  abstract = {Psychosis has significant effects on language, to the extent that its disturbance is one of the principal components of diagnosis and prognosis. In particular, two features of language seem to be prominently affected: discourse coherence, observed in patients as derailment (or tangentiality), and discourse richness, observed as poverty of speech. Using automated linguistic analysis on baseline interviews, we have shown in a previous study that it is possible to predict with high accuracy of conversion to psychosis (100\%) among a cohort of clinical high-risk youth, by quantifying the subjects’ semantic coherence and syntactic complexity as proxies for derailment and poverty of speech, respectively.1 In the present study, we seek to explore to what extent the prodromal prediction model can discriminate recent-onset schizophrenia patients from matching controls, with the intent of understanding how the prodromal-onset transition is reflected in language.Eighteen recent-onset schizophrenic patients and twelve matching controls had baseline interviews, using an open-ended protocol previously introduced.2 Using automated analysis, transcripts of interviews were evaluated for semantic and syntactic features predicting psychosis onset in an independent cohort. These features were then used to discriminate between patients and controls, applying the same classifier that predicted conversion to psychosis, namely converts laying outside the convex hull of non-converts. Additionally, we compared the discrimination power of this approach against alternative models including alternative linguistic features (e.g. metaphoricity3) and protocols (e.g. short prompts4).The convex hull of the controls subjects misclassifies only one of the patient samples, a result that amounts to 95\% true positive rate. Surrogating by label randomization and accounting for false and positive negative rates results in a balanced accuracy of 80\%, which is comparable to those obtained with alternative automated models, which range from 70\% to 85\%. Moreover, the present cohort is clearly separable from both converts and non-converts in the CHR cohort when projected in the feature space.The automated features optimized for prediction of psychotic onset convey highly significant information regarding the discrimination between recent-episode patients and controls.

  abstract = {Language and speech are the primary source of data for psychiatrists to diagnose and treat mental disorders. In psychosis, the very structure of language can be disturbed, including semantic coherence (e.g., derailment and tangentiality) and syntactic complexity (e.g., concreteness). Subtle disturbances in language are evident in schizophrenia even prior to first psychosis onset, during prodromal stages. Using computer-based natural language processing analyses, we previously showed that, among English-speaking clinical (e.g., ultra) high-risk youths, baseline reduction in semantic coherence (the flow of meaning in speech) and in syntactic complexity could predict subsequent psychosis onset with high accuracy. Herein, we aimed to cross-validate these automated linguistic analytic methods in a second larger risk cohort, also English-speaking, and to discriminate speech in psychosis from normal speech. We identified an automated machine-learning speech classifier - comprising decreased semantic coherence, greater variance in that coherence, and reduced usage of possessive pronouns - that had an 83\% accuracy in predicting psychosis onset (intra-protocol), a cross-validated accuracy of 79\% of psychosis onset prediction in the original risk cohort (cross-protocol), and a 72\% accuracy in discriminating the speech of recent-onset psychosis patients from that of healthy individuals. The classifier was highly correlated with previously identified manual linguistic predictors. Our findings support the utility and validity of automated natural language processing methods to characterize disturbances in semantics and syntax across stages of psychotic disorder. The next steps will be to apply these methods in larger risk cohorts to further test reproducibility, also in languages other than English, and identify sources of variability. This technology has the potential to improve prediction of psychosis outcome among at-risk youths and identify linguistic targets for remediation and preventive intervention. More broadly, automated linguistic analysis can be a powerful tool for diagnosis and treatment across neuropsychiatry.},

  abstract = {Given the global burden of psychotic disorders, the identification of patients with early-onset psychosis (EOP; that is, onset before the age of 18) at higher risk of adverse outcome should be a priority. A systematic search of Pubmed, Embase, and PsycInfo (1980 through August 2014) was performed to identify longitudinal observational studies assessing correlates and/or predictors of clinical, functional, cognitive, and biological outcomes in EOP. Seventy-five studies were included in the review. Using multivariate models, the most replicated predictors of worse clinical, functional, cognitive, and biological outcomes in EOP were premorbid difficulties and symptom severity (especially of negative symptoms) at baseline. Longer duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) predicted worse clinical, functional, and cognitive outcomes. Higher risk of attempting suicide was predicted by greater severity of psychotic illness and of depressive symptoms at the first episode of psychosis. Age at onset and sex were not found to be relevant predictors of outcome in most multivariate models, whereas studies using bivariate analyses yielded inconsistent results. Lower intelligence quotient at baseline predicted lower insight at follow-up, worse functional outcomes, and a diagnostic outcome of schizophrenia. Biological predictors of outcome in EOP have been little studied and have not been replicated. Lower levels of antioxidants at baseline predicted greater brain volume changes and worse cognitive functioning at follow-up, whereas neuroimaging markers such as regional cortical thickness and gray matter volume at baseline predicted remission and better insight at follow-up, respectively. EOP patients with poorer premorbid adjustment and prominent negative symptoms at initial presentation are at risk of poor outcome. They should therefore be the target of careful monitoring and more intensive interventions to address whether the disease course can be modified in this especially severely affected group. Early intervention strategies to reduce DUP may also improve outcome in EOP.},

This paper presents a method for the classification of images of silk fabrics with the aim to predict properties such as the place and time of origin and the production technique. The proposed method was developed in the context of the EU project SILKNOW (http://silknow.eu/). In the context of classification, we address the problem of limited as well as not fully labelled data and investigate the connection between the distinct variables. A pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used for the feature extraction and a classification network realizing Multi-task learning (MTL) is trained based on these features. The training procedure is adapted to enable the consideration of images that do not have a label for all tasks. Additionally, MTL with fully labeled training data is investigated for the classification of silk fabrics. The impact of both MTL approaches is compared to singletask learning based on two different class structures. We achieve overall accuracies of 92–95\,\% and average F1-scores of 88–90\,\% in our best experiments.},

Unlike standard procedures, aimed at assessing style differentiation between discrete text samples, the new method, supported with compact visualization, tries to look inside a text represented as a set of linearly sliced chunks, in order to test their stylistic consistency. Three flavors of the method have been introduced: (1) Rolling SVM, relying on the support vector machines (SVM) classifier, (2) Rolling NSC, based on the nearest shrunken centroids method, and (3) Rolling Delta, using the classic Burrowsian measure of similarity. The technique is primarily intended to assess mixed authorship; however, it can be also used as a magnifying glass to inspect works with unclear stylometric signal. To demonstrate its applicability, three different examples of collaborative work have been briefly discussed: (1) the 13th-century French allegorical poem Roman de la Rose , (2) a 15th-century translation of the Bible into Polish known as Queen Sophia’s Bible , and (3) The Inheritors , a novel collaboratively written by Joseph Conrad and Ford Madox Ford in 1901.},

We present an automated and objective approach to modeling discourse that detects very subtle deviations between probands, their first-degree relatives and unrelated healthy controls. Although these findings should be regarded as preliminary due to the limitations of the data at our disposal, we present a brief analysis of the models that best differentiate these groups in order to illustrate the utility of the method for future explorations of how language components are differentially affected by familial and illness related issues.},

However, measuring incoherence has often been complex and subjective. We sought to validate an objective, intrinsically reliable, computational approach to quantifying speech incoherence. Patients with schizophrenia and healthy control volunteers were administered a variety of language tasks. The speech generated was transcribed and the coherence computed using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). The discourse was also analyzed with a standard clinical measure of thought disorder. In word association and generation tasks LSA derived coherence scores were sensitive to differences between patients and controls, and correlated with clinical measures of thought disorder. In speech samples LSA could be used to localize where in sentence production incoherence occurs, predict levels of incoherence as well as whether discourse "belonged" to a patient or control. In conclusion, LSA can be used to assay disordered language production so as to both complement human clinical ratings as well as experimentally parse this incoherence in a theory-driven manner.},

  abstract = {Automated language analysis of speech has been shown to distinguish healthy control (HC) vs chronic schizophrenia (SZ) groups, yet the predictive power on first-episode psychosis patients (FEP) and the generalization to non-English speakers remain unclear. We performed a cross-sectional and longitudinal (18 months) automated language analysis in 133 Spanish-speaking subjects from three groups: healthy control or HC (n\,=\,49), FEP (n\,=\,40), and chronic SZ (n\,=\,44). Interviews were manually transcribed, and the analysis included 30 language features (4 verbal fluency; 20 verbal productivity; 6 semantic coherence). Our cross-sectional analysis showed that using the top ten ranked and decorrelated language features, an automated HC vs SZ classification achieved 85.9\% accuracy. In our longitudinal analysis, 28 FEP patients were diagnosed with SZ at the end of the study. Here, combining demographics, PANSS, and language information, the prediction accuracy reached 77.5\% mainly driven by semantic coherence information. Overall, we showed that language features from Spanish-speaking clinical interviews can distinguish HC vs chronic SZ, and predict SZ diagnosis in FEP patients.},

  abstract = {Objectives: This study aimed to (1) determine the feasibility of collecting behavioral data from participants hospitalized with acute psychosis and (2) begin to evaluate the clinical information that can be computationally derived from such data. Methods: Behavioral data was collected across 99 sessions from 38 participants recruited from an inpatient psychiatric unit. Each session started with a semi-structured interview modeled on a typical ``clinical rounds'' encounter and included administration of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Analysis: We quantified aspects of participants' verbal behavior during the interview using lexical, coherence, and disfluency features. We then used two complementary approaches to explore our second objective. The first approach used predictive models to estimate participants' PANSS scores from their language features. Our second approach used inferential models to quantify the relationships between individual language features and symptom measures. Results: Our predictive models showed promise but lacked sufficient data to achieve clinically useful accuracy. Our inferential models identified statistically significant relationships between numerous language features and symptom domains. Conclusion: Our interview recording procedures were well-tolerated and produced adequate data for transcription and analysis. The results of our inferential modeling suggest that automatic measurements of expressive language contain signals highly relevant to the assessment of psychosis. These findings establish the potential of measuring language during a clinical interview in a naturalistic setting and generate specific hypotheses that can be tested in future studies. This, in turn, will lead to more accurate modeling and better understanding of the relationships between expressive language and psychosis.},

  abstract = {Weaving is presented in this paper with relation to the four key categories of computational thinking: decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithms.~The role of weaving for the development of theoretical concepts is underestimated, because we perceive weaving as a minor craft with little technological challenge and impact. Where technological progress is measured in terms of gaining time from dull and tedious repetitive tasks, weaving appears to be the archetype of such repetitive work and thus as the more technological the faster it goes. We address this framing of perception by presenting ancient weaving as the earliest binary and digital technology. The PENELOPE project (ERC CoGrant no. 682711) aims to develop a theory of weaving as part of a deep history and epistemology for digital technology. In explicating the mathematical and computing principles invoked in weaving, we furthermore explore weaving as a kind of education that has the potential to engage tacit knowledge that is necessary to make technical and aesthetic choices in coding. By this, we argue for an alternative history of digital art.},

  abstract = {The language and speech of individuals with psychosis reflect their impairments in cognition and motor processes. These language disturbances can be used to identify individuals with and at high risk for psychosis, as well as help track and predict symptom progression, allowing for early intervention and improved outcomes. However, current methods of language assessment - manual annotations and/or clinical rating scales - are time intensive, expensive, subject to bias, and difficult to administer on a wide scale, limiting this area from reaching its full potential. Computational methods that can automatically perform linguistic analysis have started to be applied to this problem and could drastically improve our ability to use linguistic information clinically. In this article, we first review how these automated, computational methods work and how they have been applied to the field of psychosis. We show that across domains, these methods have captured differences between individuals with psychosis and healthy controls and can classify individuals with high accuracies, demonstrating the promise of these methods. We then consider the obstacles that need to be overcome before these methods can play a significant role in the clinical process and provide suggestions for how the field should address them. In particular, while much of the work thus far has focused on demonstrating the successes of these methods, we argue that a better understanding of when and why these models fail will be crucial toward ensuring these methods reach their potential in the field of psychosis.},

The network employs a bipartite structure that enables long-range interactions across the image, while maintaining computation of linear efficiency, that can readily scale to high-resolution synthesis. It iteratively propagates information from a set of latent variables to the evolving visual features and vice versa, to support the refinement of each in light of the other and encourage the emergence of compositional representations of objects and scenes. In contrast to the classic transformer architecture, it utilizes multiplicative integration that allows flexible region-based modulation, and can thus be seen as a generalization of the successful StyleGAN network. We demonstrate the model's strength and robustness through a careful evaluation over a range of datasets, from simulated multi-object environments to rich real-world indoor and outdoor scenes, showing it achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of image quality and diversity, while enjoying fast learning and better data-efficiency. Further qualitative and quantitative experiments offer us an insight into the model's inner workings, revealing improved interpretability and stronger disentanglement, and illustrating the benefits and efficacy of our approach.

In parallel, the ubiquitous collection of unconventional data sources (e.g. mobile health, digital phenotyping, consumer neurotechnology) is increasing the variety of data points. Big data analytics and approaches to Artificial Intelligence (AI) such as advanced machine learning are showing great potential to make sense of these larger and heterogeneous data flows. AI provides great opportunities for making new discoveries about the brain, improving current preventative and diagnostic models in both neurology and psychiatry and developing more effective assistive neurotechnologies. Concurrently, it raises many new methodological and ethical challenges. Given their transformative nature, it is still largely unclear how AI-driven approaches to the study of the human brain will meet adequate standards of scientific validity and affect normative instruments in neuroethics and research ethics. This manuscript provides an overview of current AI-driven approaches to clinical neuroscience and an assessment of the associated key methodological and ethical challenges. In particular, it will discuss what ethical principles are primarily affected by AI approaches to human neuroscience, and what normative safeguards should be enforced in this domain.},

We develop a proof of principle service user supervised machine learning pipeline to identify stigmatising tweets reliably and understand the prevalence of public schizophrenia stigma on Twitter. A service user group advised on the machine learning model evaluation metric (fewest false negatives) and features for machine learning. We collected 13,313 public tweets on schizophrenia between January and May 2018. Two service user researchers manually identified stigma in 746 English tweets; 80\% were used to train eight models, and 20\% for testing. The two models with fewest false negatives were compared in two service user validation exercises, and the best model used to classify all extracted public English tweets. Tweets classed as stigmatising by service users were more negative in sentiment (t (744)\,=\,12.02, p\,{$<$}\,0.001 [95\% CI: 0.196–0.273]). Our linear Support Vector Machine was the best performing model with fewest false negatives and higher service user validation. This model identified public stigma in 47\% of English tweets (n5,676) which were more negative in sentiment (t (12,143)\,=\,64.38, p\,{$<$}\,0.001 [95\% CI: 0.29–0.31]). Machine learning can identify stigmatising tweets at large scale, with service user involvement. Given the prevalence of stigma, there is an urgent need for education and online campaigns to reduce it. Machine learning can provide a real time metric on their success.},

To correct this survivorship bias, we applied unseen species models from ecology to gauge the loss of narratives from medieval Europe, such as the romances about King Arthur. The estimates obtained are compatible with the scant historic evidence. In addition to events such as library fires, we identified the original evenness of cultural populations as an overlooked factor in these assemblages’ stability in the face of immaterial loss. We link the elevated evenness in island literatures to analogous accounts of ecological and cultural diversity in insular communities. These analyses call for a wider application of these methods across the heritage sciences.},

  abstract = {Groups at MIT and NYU have collected a dataset of millions of tiny colour images from the web. It is, in principle, an excellent dataset for unsupervised training of deep generative models, but previous researchers who have tried this have found it dicult to learn a good set of lters from the images. We show how to train a multi-layer generative model that learns to extract meaningful features which resemble those found in the human visual cortex. Using a novel parallelization algorithm to distribute the work among multiple machines connected on a network, we show how training such a model can be done in reasonable time. A second problematic aspect of the tiny images dataset is that there are no reliable class labels which makes it hard to use for object recognition experiments. We created two sets of reliable labels. The CIFAR-10 set has 6000 examples of each of 10 classes and the CIFAR-100 set has 600 examples of each of 100 non-overlapping classes. Using these labels, we show that object recognition is signicantly improved by pre-training a layer of features on a large set of unlabeled tiny images.},

L’analyse linguistico-pragmatique des états mentaux dans le discours des psychothérapeutes est un exemple d’application de cette méthode d’analyse. Elle permet d’identifier et de dénombrer les indices langagiers renvoyant à l’expression verbale des états mentaux. Cette méthode a été appliquée à 32 retranscriptions d’entretien (16 entretiens thérapeutiques et 16 entretiens de recherche). Les résultats ont montré que les psychothérapeutes utilisent davantage d’indices langagiers d’états mentaux que les chercheurs et qu’ils font référence à tous les types d’états mentaux. Les psychothérapeutes Centrés sur la Personne ont plus recours aux indices langagiers d’impression-sensation; et les thérapeutes d’inspiration psychanalytique à ceux d’émotion.

  abstract = {Background Schizophrenia is a disease associated with high burden, and improvement in care is necessary. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used to diagnose several medical conditions as well as psychiatric disorders. However, this technology requires large amounts of data to be efficient. Social media data could be used to improve diagnostic capabilities. Objective The objective of our study is to analyze the current capabilities of AI to use social media data as a diagnostic tool for psychotic disorders. Methods A systematic review of the literature was conducted using several databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, PsycInfo, and IEEE Xplore) using relevant keywords to search for articles published as of November 12, 2021. We used the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) criteria to identify, select, and critically assess the quality of the relevant studies while minimizing bias. We critically analyzed the methodology of the studies to detect any bias and presented the results. Results Among the 93 studies identified, 7 studies were included for analyses. The included studies presented encouraging results. Social media data could be used in several ways to care for patients with schizophrenia, including the monitoring of patients after the first episode of psychosis. We identified several limitations in the included studies, mainly lack of access to clinical diagnostic data, small sample size, and heterogeneity in study quality. We recommend using state-of-the-art natural language processing neural networks, called language models, to model social media activity. Combined with the synthetic minority oversampling technique, language models can tackle the imbalanced data set limitation, which is a necessary constraint to train unbiased classifiers. Furthermore, language models can be easily adapted to the classification task with a procedure called “fine-tuning.” Conclusions The use of social media data for the diagnosis of psychotic disorders is promising. However, most of the included studies had significant biases; we therefore could not draw conclusions about accuracy in clinical situations. Future studies need to use more accurate methodologies to obtain unbiased results.},

  abstract = {Some of the cognitive impairments of schizophrenia are already detectable before the onset of the disease, and could help to identify individuals at higher risk of psychosis. In patients with schizophrenia, semantic verbal fluency (VF) is more impaired than phonological fluency. We investigated whether the same profile is present in young patients at Ultra High Risk of psychosis (UHR). One hundred and fifty six young patients (15–30y.o.) consecutively seeking help at our specialized youth mental health center with no definite psychiatric diagnoses were recruited and assessed with the CAARMS. Individuals meeting the criteria for UHR were compared to the remaining patients considered as Help Seeker Controls (HSCo). UHR individuals had a lower mean total semantic fluency score than HSCo. This effect was significant for each semantic category (‘animals’ and ‘fruits’). By contrast, there were no differences in phonological fluency scores between UHR and HSCo either in the total score or when each letter (‘P’ and ‘R’) was considered separately. Semantic but not phonological VF differentiated UHR individuals from non-psychotic help-seeking young adults. These results suggest that semantic deficits are present during the prodromal phase, prior to clinical expression of full-blown psychosis, and suggest that prodromes could be associated with alteration in temporal brain areas.},

Computer content analytic procedures, which quantify thematic emphases in the subjects' free speech, have been shown to differentiate schizophrenic patients from other acutely ill psychiatric patients and from normal controls. We repeated the speech sampling procedure with hospitalized psychiatric patients in Turkey, and analyzed their responses using content analysis procedures with a translation of the dictionary or language classification system used in the original studies of English-speaking patients in the United States. Eighty subjects were included in the study: 20 schizophrenics, 20 depressives, 20 manics and 20 healthy controls. There were ten females and ten males in each group. After being diagnosed separately by two clinicians using the Turkish version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID), each subject's free speech was tape-recorded in a standardized session. The speech content of Turkish patients with schizophrenia exhibited considerable similarity to that previously observed in American subjects, but there were certain dissimilarities that appeared to reflect the impact of culture on the manifestations of the schizophrenic disorder. The phenomenological differences between the three psychiatric syndromes compared were also reflected in the results of the content analysis. The most dissimilar syndromes were mania and depression whereas the most similar were mania and schizophrenia. The particular word categories emphasized by specific groups also appeared to be consistent with the effects of their psychiatric disorders.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

To that end, several automated measures to quantify disorganisation of transcribed speech have been proposed. However, it remains unclear which measures are most strongly associated with psychosis, how different measures are related to each other and what the best strategies are to collect speech data from participants. Here, we assessed whether twelve automated Natural Language Processing markers could differentiate transcribed speech excerpts from subjects at clinical high risk for psychosis, first episode psychosis patients and healthy control subjects (total N\,=\,54). In-line with previous work, several measures showed significant differences between groups, including semantic coherence, speech graph connectivity and a measure of whether speech was on-topic, the latter of which outperformed the related measure of tangentiality. Most NLP measures examined were only weakly related to each other, suggesting they provide complementary information. Finally, we compared the ability of transcribed speech generated using different tasks to differentiate the groups. Speech generated from picture descriptions of the Thematic Apperception Test and a story re-telling task outperformed free speech, suggesting that choice of speech generation method may be an important consideration. Overall, quantitative speech markers represent a promising direction for future clinical applications.},

Here we report that a graph-theoretical computational analysis of verbal reports from subjects spanning 6 decades of age and 2 decades of education reveals asymptotic changes over time that depend more on education than age. In typical subjects, short-range recurrence and lexical diversity stabilize after elementary school, whereas graph size and long-range recurrence only steady after high school. Short-range recurrence decreases towards random levels, while lexical diversity, long-range recurrence, and graph size increase away from near-randomness towards a plateau in educated adults. Subjects with psychosis do not show similar dynamics, presenting at adulthood a children-like discourse structure. Typical subjects increase the range of word recurrence over school years, but the same feature in subjects with psychosis resists education.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Psychosis has various causes, including mania and schizophrenia. Since the differential diagnosis of psychosis is exclusively based on subjective assessments of oral interviews with patients, an objective quantification of the speech disturbances that characterize mania and schizophrenia is in order. In principle, such quantification could be achieved by the analysis of speech graphs. A graph represents a network with nodes connected by edges; in speech graphs, nodes correspond to words and edges correspond to semantic and grammatical relationships. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To quantify speech differences related to psychosis, interviews with schizophrenics, manics and normal subjects were recorded and represented as graphs. Manics scored significantly higher than schizophrenics in ten graph measures. Psychopathological symptoms such as logorrhea, poor speech, and flight of thoughts were grasped by the analysis even when verbosity differences were discounted. Binary classifiers based on speech graph measures sorted schizophrenics from manics with up to 93.8\% of sensitivity and 93.7\% of specificity. In contrast, sorting based on the scores of two standard psychiatric scales (BPRS and PANSS) reached only 62.5\% of sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results demonstrate that alterations of the thought process manifested in the speech of psychotic patients can be objectively measured using graph-theoretical tools, developed to capture specific features of the normal and dysfunctional flow of thought, such as divergence and recurrence. The quantitative analysis of speech graphs is not redundant with standard psychometric scales but rather complementary, as it yields a very accurate sorting of schizophrenics and manics. Overall, the results point to automated psychiatric diagnosis based not on what is said, but on how it is said.},

  abstract = {In chronic psychotic patients, word graph analysis shows potential as complementary psychiatric assessment. This analysis relies mostly on connectedness, a structural feature of speech that is anti-correlated with negative symptoms. Here we aimed to verify whether speech disorganization during the first clinical contact, as measured by graph connectedness, can correctly classify negative symptoms and the schizophrenia diagnosis 6 months in advance. Positive and negative syndrome scale scores and memory reports were collected from 21 patients undergoing first clinical contact for recent-onset psychosis, followed for 6 months to establish diagnosis, and compared to 21 well-matched healthy subjects. Each report was represented as a word-trajectory graph. Connectedness was measured by number of edges, number of nodes in the largest connected component and number of nodes in the largest strongly connected component. Similarities to random graphs were estimated. All connectedness attributes were combined into a single Disorganization Index weighted by the correlation with the positive and negative syndrome scale negative subscale, and used for classifications. Random-like connectedness was more prevalent among schizophrenia patients (64\,×\,5\% in Control group, p\,=\,0.0002). Connectedness from two kinds of memory reports (dream and negative image) explained 88\% of negative symptoms variance (p\,{$<$}\,0.0001). The Disorganization Index classified low vs. high severity of negative symptoms with 100\% accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve\,=\,1), and schizophrenia diagnosis with 91.67\% accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve\,=\,0.85). The index was validated in an independent cohort of chronic psychotic patients and controls (N\,=\,60) (85\% accuracy). Thus, speech disorganization during the first clinical contact correlates tightly with negative symptoms, and is quite discriminative of the schizophrenia diagnosis.},

  abstract = {Graphical representations of speech generate powerful computational measures related to psychosis. Previous studies have mostly relied on structural relations between words as the basis of graph formation, i.e., connecting each word to the next in a sequence of words. Here, we introduced a method of graph formation grounded in semantic relationships by identifying elements that act upon each other (action relation) and the contents of those actions (predication relation). Speech from picture descriptions and open-ended narrative tasks were collected from a cross-diagnostic group of healthy volunteers and people with psychotic or non-psychotic disorders. Recordings were transcribed and underwent automated language processing, including semantic role labeling to identify action and predication relations. Structural and semantic graph features were computed using static and dynamic (moving-window) techniques. Compared to structural graphs, semantic graphs were more strongly correlated with dimensional psychosis symptoms. Dynamic features also outperformed static features, and samples from picture descriptions yielded larger effect sizes than narrative responses for psychosis diagnoses and symptom dimensions. Overall, semantic graphs captured unique and clinically meaningful information about psychosis and related symptom dimensions. These features, particularly when derived from semi-structured tasks using dynamic measurement, are meaningful additions to the repertoire of computational linguistic methods in psychiatry.},

This self-presentation is more identifiable than the effects of any other patient characteristic, even if the delusion is not discussed by the patient.

The goal of CORLI is to promote and provide tools and information for good and efficient research practices in corpus linguistics, especially on spoken language corpora. Because of the time required to collect and transcribe spoken language resources, their number is limited and thus corpora need to be interoperable and reusable in order to improve research on themes such as phonology, prosody, interaction, syntax, and textometry. To help researchers reach this goal, CORLI has designed a pair of tools: TEICORPO to assist in the conversion and use of spoken language corpora, and TEIMETA for metadata purposes. TEICORPO is based on the principle of an underlying common format, namely TEI XML as described in its specification for spoken language use (ISO 2016). This tool enables the conversion of transcriptions created with alignment software such as CLAN, Transcriber, Praat, or ELAN as well as common file formats (CSV, XLSX, TXT, or DOCX) and the TEI format, which plays the role of a lossless pivot format. Backward conversion is possible in many cases, with limitations inherent in the destination target format. TEICORPO can run the Treetagger part-of-speech tagger and the Stanford CoreNLP tools on TEI files and can export the resulting files to textometric tools such as TXM, Le Trameur, or Iramuteq, making it suitable for spoken language corpora editing as well as for various research purposes.},

The pragmatic deficits regard various pragmatic phenomena, e.g., direct and indirect communicative acts, deceit, irony, and include not only the use of language but also other expressive means such as non-verbal/extralinguistic modalities, e.g., gestures and body movements, and paralinguistic cues, e.g., prosody and tone of voice. The present paper focuses on the identification of those pragmatic features, i.e., communicative phenomena and expressive modalities, that more reliably discriminate between individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls. We performed a multimodal assessment of communicative-pragmatic ability, and applied a machine learning approach, specifically a Decision Tree model, with the aim of identifying the pragmatic features that best separate the data into the two groups, i.e., individuals with schizophrenia and healthy controls, and represent their configuration. The results indicated good overall performance of the Decision Tree model, with mean Accuracy of 82\%, Sensitivity of 76\%, and Precision of 91\%. Linguistic irony emerged as the most relevant pragmatic phenomenon in distinguishing between the two groups, followed by violation of the Gricean maxims, and then extralinguistic deceitful and sincere communicative acts. The results are discussed in light of the pragmatic theoretical literature, and their clinical relevance in terms of content and design of both assessment and rehabilitative training.},

While several studies have investigated pragmatic performance of patients with SCZ, little research has analyzed the errors committed in the comprehension of different communicative acts. The present research investigated error patterns in 24 patients with SCZ and 24 healthy controls (HC) during a task assessing the comprehension of different communicative acts, i.e., sincere, deceitful and ironic, and their relationship with the clinical features of SCZ. We used signal detection analysis to quantify participants’ ability to correctly detect the speakers’ communicative intention, i.e., sensitivity, and their tendency to wrongly perceive a communicative intention when not present, i.e., response bias. Further, we investigated the relationship between sensitivity and response bias, and the clinical features of the disorder, namely symptom severity, pharmacotherapy, and personal and social functioning. The results showed that the ability to infer the speaker’s communicative intention is impaired in SCZ, as patients exhibited lower sensitivity, compared to HC, for all the pragmatic phenomena evaluated, i.e., sincere, deceitful, and ironic communicative acts. Further, we found that the sensitivity measure for irony was related to disorganized/concrete symptoms. Moreover, patients with SCZ showed a stronger response bias for deceitful communicative acts compared to HC: when committing errors, they tended to misattribute deceitful intentions more often than sincere and ironic ones. This tendency to misattribute deceitful communicative intentions may be related to the attributional bias characterizing the disorder.},

  abstract = {L'identification de l'auteur d'un texte anonyme par l'analyse de ses écrits est un domaine qui a fait 1' objet de nombreuses recherches, depuis plusieurs siècles. En effet, les premières études datent du 19e siècle. À cette époque, les chercheurs utilisaient uniquement des techniques statistiques pour identifier les auteurs. Les études réalisées par Medenhall en 1887 en sont un très bon exemple, prouvant l'efficacité des outils statistiques pour l'identification d'auteurs. Medenhall a mis en valeur la corrélation entre la distribution des mots et leur longueur dans les oeuvres d'un même auteur. En appliquant ses méthodes sur les pièces de théâtre shakespeariennes, il a découvert des liens entre les écrits de Shakespeare et de Marlowe. Cependant, l'étude qui a le plus influencé l'avenir de l'identification des auteurs est sans doute celle de Mosteller et Wallace en 1964 sur le fédéraliste, un recueil de 146 articles politiques publiés anonymement sous le pseudonyme "Publius" entre 1787 et 1788. Mosteller et Wallace arrivèrent à identifier les auteurs du fédéraliste en utilisant les méthodes d'identification d'auteurs. Plusieurs autres travaux ont permis d'isoler des indices caractérisant le style d'écriture d'auteurs afin d'identifier l'auteur d'une oeuvre dont la paternité est mise en doute. Ces indices sont dits stylistiques car ils permettent de capturer le style des auteurs et sont généralement invariables dans les oeuvres d'un auteur. En outre, les techniques d'identification d'auteurs ont de nombreuses applications telles que démasquer les individus qui profitent de l'anonymat offert par Internet et les réseaux sociaux pour menacer ou commettre des crimes comme l'intimidation. Dans plusieurs cas, les techniques d'identification d'auteurs ont permis de réduire les listes des potentiels suspects lors d'enquêtes, et ont souvent été utilisées lors de procès pour inculper ou disculper des accusés. Entre temps, la stylométrie a vu le jour dans les années 1990. Il s'agit d'un nouveau domaine de recherche ayant pour mission de découvrir de nouveaux indices stylistiques . Plusieurs avancées ont été effectuées dans le domaine donnant naissance à un nombre élevé d'indices de tout genre. En effet, il existe plus de 1000 différents indices stylométriques de plusieurs natures, soient lexicales, grammaticales ou sémantiques. Toutefois, il est crucial de trouver de nouveaux indices permettant d'identifier les auteurs avec précision et pouvant être utilisés sur des textes de longueurs et de natures diverses. Dans le même contexte, des études ont démontré que la combinaison de plusieurs indices stylistiques améliore le taux de succès des techniques d'identification d'auteurs. Par conséquent, la découverte de nouveaux indices personnels qui peuvent capturer la signature stylistique d'un auteur est un domaine de recherche important avec de véritables défis. C'est dans cette optique que nous proposons dans cette thèse deux nouveaux indices stylistiques de types syntaxiques utilisant les n-grammes ou skip-grammes (n-grammes avec sauts) constitués d'étiquettes morphosyntaxiques. Notre choix s'est porté sur les indices syntaxiques puisque leur usage est inconscient par les auteurs. Notre premier indice cherche les k motifs les plus fréquents constitués den-grammes d'étiquettes morphosyntaxiques à taille variable pour construire les signatures des auteurs. Une étude expérimentale avec un corpus, de 30 livres et 10 auteurs pour un total de 99, 903 phrases, extrait du Projet Gutenberg, démontre qu'il est possible d'identifier les auteurs avec un rappel de plus de 73\% en utilisant un petit nombre de motifs (par exemple, k = 50). Le second indice exploite la possibilité qu'offrent les skip-grammes de permettre des sauts entre des étiquettes morphosyntaxiques adjacentes. Cela permet de détecter les habitudes qu'ont certains auteurs à utiliser des structures de phrases plus complexes. Une étude expérimentale utilisant le même corpus montre que les auteurs peuvent être identifiés avec un rappel de plus de 70\% en utilisant un petit nombre de motifs (e.g. k = 250) et un seul saut (par exemple, saut = 1) entre les étiquettes morphosyntaxiques. En terminant, nous exploitons nos deux indices sur un corpus de billets de blogues écrits par 10 auteurs afin de mesurer les performances de nos indices et notre approche sur un corpus de thématique et de taille différente. Les résultats obtenus montrent que les auteurs peuvent être identifiés avec une très bonne exactitude. Mots clés: identification d'auteurs, stylométrie, étiquettes morphosyntaxiques, n-grammes, skip-grammes, motifs séquentiels à taille variable},

  abstract = {The present studies demonstrate two computerized approaches to examining the expression of depression on the Internet. Study 1 observed linguistic markers of depression in English and Spanish forums. English and Spanish posts by depressed (N=160) and non-depressed individuals (N=160) were collected from Internet forums using bulletin board systems (bbs). A computer program (LIWC2001) was used to compare linguistic categories across groups within the English and Spanish language. Study 2 analyzed the themes people use when talking about their depression in forums in English and Spanish. Posts by English speaking (N=404) and Spanish speaking depressed people (N=400) were collected from bbs. An automated inductive approach to content analysis was used to compare how the expression of depression varies across cultures. The results for Study 1 showed that linguistic cues previously associated with depression were found to be higher in depressed than in non-depressed posts in English and Spanish. Study 2 showed that depressed people who wrote in Spanish were more likely to mention relational concerns than depressed people who wrote in English, who were more likely to mention medicinal concerns. Implications for informational and support needs and concerns in psychotherapy vs. online support across cultures are addressed and discussed.},

  abstract = {Subtle features in people’s everyday language may harbor the signs of future mental illness. Machine learning offers an approach for the rapid and accurate extraction of these signs. Here we investigate two potential linguistic indicators of psychosis in 40 participants of the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study. We demonstrate how the linguistic marker of semantic density can be obtained using the mathematical method of vector unpacking, a technique that decomposes the meaning of a sentence into its core ideas. We also demonstrate how the latent semantic content of an individual’s speech can be extracted by contrasting it with the contents of conversations generated on social media, here 30,000 contributors to Reddit. The results revealed that conversion to psychosis is signaled by low semantic density and talk about voices and sounds. When combined, these two variables were able to predict the conversion with 93\% accuracy in the training and 90\% accuracy in the holdout datasets. The results point to a larger project in which automated analyses of language are used to forecast a broad range of mental disorders well in advance of their emergence.},

Chez Daniel Paul Schreber, Antonin Artaud et David Nebreda, par exemple, le souffle de l’inspiration ne se révèle pas purement néantisant et destructeur, mais il réintroduit du jeu/je dans le langage, ranimant ainsi le sujet par des voies/voix détournées.},

Deep learning networks are used to predict various outcomes for patients with schizophrenia. Deep learning neural networks and SVMs are used in the schizophrenia drug discovery process. AI-powered avatar therapy and socially interactive robots are used in the therapy of patients with schizophrenia. At the time of this writing, use of AI techniques is starting to switch from the research setting to the clinical setting to help diagnose and treat patients with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-related disorders.

The long-term aim of the project is to contribute to the preclinical detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by developing a computer model that searches for linguistic changes that mark AD. To this end, we will automatically analyze the history of electronic messages, such as those communicated via WhatsApp, Messenger and e-mails, of clinically normal participants and AD patients. The literature about the automatic detection of AD using linguistic input has shown that productions from AD patients are automatically distinguishable from productions of normal older adults. Furthermore, case studies about authors who developed AD themselves suggest that their writing style progressively changes as a result of the disease. With respect to existing corpora containing linguistic materials from AD patients, the data that we collect will form a unique corpus; we are not aware of other resources featuring such longitudinal data. In this article, we argue how our project will contribute to the research on AD and discuss our considerations on collecting, processing and sharing the project's data. We also speculate how the data could be used to develop an automated tool for preclinical detection of AD.},

  abstract = {Background Detecting Alzheimer’s disease (AD) before the onset of symptoms is crucial for the development of effective treatment (1). As biomarkers are costly and/or invasive, there is a need for cost-efficient and non-invasive methods that can indicate which individuals need further examination. We present a running project that aims at developing a screening tool applicable to the general population by automatically analyzing the history of electronic messages such as WhatsApp and e-mails over a period of several years prior to the analysis. Method In the first phase of the project (model construction), 30 prodromal or mildly demented AD patients (with biomarkers-confirmed diagnosis) and 30 clinically normal elderly volunteers are recruited to donate their electronic message histories. Data is gathered and processed according to the General Data Protection Regulation and only sent messages are considered, which are codified to hide personal information. Automatic linguistic analyses are conducted on this data, such as syntactic parsing and lexical analysis and used by machine learning algorithms that establish the evolution of the linguistic abilities of a participant over time. Specifically, we will test how long before AD diagnosis linguistic changes are noticeable versus clinically normal volunteers. In the second phase of the project (model testing), 200 elderly volunteers without AD diagnosis will be recruited to donate their electronic message history and genetically tested for Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4). We hypothesize that our tool will identify changes in linguistic practices suggestive of preclinical AD more frequently in APOE4 carriers than in non-carriers. Result We are currently collecting and processing data from patients and clinically normal volunteers. We started to run our first linguistic analyses on the data, but we do not have enough participants yet to train a computer model. Conclusion If detection of preclinical AD using linguistic markers from electronic message history turns out to be effective, the tool we develop could play an important role in the non-invasive and cost-efficient screening of preclinical AD in the elderly population. Specifically, it could facilitate clinical trials in preclinical AD. Reference (1) McDade, E. and Bateman, R. J. (2017). Stop Alzheimer’s before it starts. Nature News, 547(7662):153.},

Language use within the poems was analyzed within the context of 2 suicide models. In line with a model of social integration, writings of suicidal poets contained more words pertaining to the individual self and fewer words pertaining to the collective than did those of nonsuicidal poets. In addition, the direction of effects for words pertaining to communication was consistent with the social integration model of suicide. The study found support for a model that suggests that suicidal individuals are detached from others and are preoccupied with self. Furthermore, the findings suggest that linguistic predictors of suicide can be discerned through text analysis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Release 4.5.0 is codenamed ‘The Release of One’s Own’. This release introduces new features and resolves a number of issues raised by the TEI community. As always, the majority of these changes and corrections are a consequence of feature requests or bugs reported by the TEI community using the GitHub tracking system. A full list of the issues resolved in the course of this release cycle may be found under the 4.5.0 milestone. The following changes are particularly worth highlighting in this release: New encoding features Sex and gender have been revised in the Guidelines (\#2189, \#2190), this includes The introduction of the new element gender specifying the gender identity of a person, persona, or character. The introduction of the new datatype teidata.gender defining the range of attribute values used to represent the gender of a person, persona, or character. The revision of the discussion of traits and states in the subsection on Basic Principles. Documentation and guidance in various places of Chapter 13 Names, Dates, People, and Places. The revision of the elements sex, person, persona as well as the datatype teidata.sex. The Guidelines now allow for nested ab elements (\#1856). The changes include The introduction of the new macro macro.abContent defining the content of anonymous block elements. The introduction of the new element class model.paraPart that groups elements that may appear in paragraphs and similar elements. Changing the content model for ab from macro.paraContent to macro.abContent. The revision of the descriptions of paragraphs in the subsection on Paragraphs and of anonymous blocks in the subsection on Blocks, Segments, and Anchors. Making model.gLike, model.global, model.inter, model.lLike, model.phrase, and lg members of the new element class model.paraPart. Changes to content models With the introduction of model.describedResource the Guidelines and the data model for teiCorpus are now consistent (\#1823). The content model of textLang has been changed from macro.phraseSeq to macro.specialPara (\#2248). The measure element is now a member of the attribute class att.ranging, and examples have been added to demonstrate the use of attributes for encoding numerical ranges on measure (\#2254). The constraint for the calendar attribute of att.datable has been broadened to flag as an error a date element which has a calendar attribute but has only whitespace content (\#2257). The constraint for the location attribute in variantEncoding has been simplified (\#2259). The listBibl element is now allowed as a child of abstract (\#2292). A constraint has been added that requires that there is no text content within a zone or line element that is itself within a facsimile element (\#2300). Improvements of prose and examples A passage that incorrectly implied that figure is a member of the model.titlepagePart class has been re-written (\#2228). The relationship between hand and handShift has been clarified (\#2338). The outdated references to ISOCat have been updated in Chapter 9 Dictionaries, Chapter 18 Feature Structures, gram, and att.datcat. In the course of this the attributes datcat and valueDatcat have been removed from the {$<$}code{$>$}dcr:{$<$}/code{$>$} namespace and are now native TEI attributes. Additionally, the targetDatcat attribute has been added to the attribute class att.datcat. This change is illustrated by examples in the sections mentioned. English glosses have been added to scriptDesc, transcriptionDesc, modelGrp, noteGrp, surfaceGrp, and att.declaring (PR \#2308, PR \#2302, PR \#2293). A number of translations have been added, updated or improved (\#2241, PR \#2233, PR \#2234, PR \#2237, PR \#2240, PR \#2281, PR \#2294, PR \#2305, PR \#2310, PR \#2311, PR \#2312, PR \#2322, PR \#2323, PR \#2324, PR \#2348). In addition, over a dozen typos, unclear expressions, and incorrect encodings have been corrected (\#2222, \#2289, PR \#2351). Documentation The documentation on Customizing TEI to Check Pointers by Syd Bauman has been published (1675). Housekeeping The datatypes teidata.pointer, teidata.namespace, and teidata.namespaceOrName have been restricted so that they do not allow any whitespace in a URI (\#2185). Improvements of the TEI encoding of examples have been made (\#2314, \#2297). The elements charName and glyphName have been removed from the tei\_simplePrint exemplar ODD to align with the changes made in the 4.4.0 release (\#2283). Some constraints in tei\_customization have been removed now that the elements dataSpec and macroSpec allow at most one content or valList element (\#2318). Misleading documentation for the prefix attribute of the elementSpec element has been removed (\#2319). The schematron definition for reporting unused rendition definitions in jTEI articles has been improved (\#PR 2325). Constraints on dataFacet and restriction have been made explicit in the dataRef element (\#2326. The datatype teidata.unboundedInt has been renamed to teidata.unboundedCount (\#2327). Missing ISO references have been added to the bibliography (PR \#2344). The references to the ISO 8601 standard named in the att.datable.iso and teidata.temporal.iso have been updated with the version number 2004 (PR \#2250). Vestigal declarations of the RelaxNG namespace have been removed (PR \#2353). The values of the datatype teidata.outputMeasure have been updated to the latest CSS3 Candidate Recommendation (PR \#2354). Various minor (but helpful) improvements have been made to our internal build process (\#2267 and \#551). In addition, many improvements have been made to the XSLT stylesheets (which provide processing of TEI ODD files for Roma and TEIGarage as well as other TEI conversions). The Stylesheets are maintained separately from the Guidelines at https://github.com/TEIC/Stylesheets. A full list of the issues resolved in the course of this release cycle may be found under the 7.54.0 milestone.},

  abstract = {Understanding how people who commit suicide perceive their cognitive states and emotions represents an important open scientific challenge. We build upon cognitive network science, psycholinguistics and semantic frame theory to introduce a network representation of suicidal ideation as expressed in multiple suicide notes. By reconstructing the knowledge structure of such notes, we reveal interconnections between the ideas and emotional states of people who committed suicide through an analysis of emotional balance motivated by structural balance theory, semantic prominence and emotional profiling. Our results indicate that connections between positively- and negatively-valenced terms give rise to a degree of balance that is significantly higher than in a null model where the affective structure is randomized and in a linguistic baseline model capturing mind-wandering in absence of suicidal ideation. We show that suicide notes are affectively compartmentalized such that positive concepts tend to cluster together and dominate the overall network structure. Notably, this positive clustering diverges from perceptions of self, which are found to be dominated by negative, sad conceptual associations in analyses based on subject-verb-object relationships and emotional profiling. A key positive concept is “love”, which integrates information relating the self to others and is semantically prominent across suicide notes. The emotions constituting the semantic frame of “love” combine joy and trust with anticipation and sadness, which can be linked to psychological theories of meaning-making as well as narrative psychology. Our results open new ways for understanding the structure of genuine suicide notes and may be used to inform future research on suicide prevention.},
